## Global Video Game Sales Analysis
As a child, I spent countless hours immersed in the cyberworld and played a wide variety of games from the comfort of my room. Now my passion has become my profession as a video game tester and I use the same passion to ensure that games are bug-free to meet the highest standards of playability. Besides testing, my interests have evolved to include data analysis to help improve future gaming experiences. 
Therefore in this project, I will explore and visualize the relevant questions.
