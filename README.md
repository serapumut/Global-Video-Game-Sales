## Global Video Game Sales Analysis
As a child, I spent countless hours immersed in the cyberworld and played a wide variety of games from the comfort of my room. Now my passion has become my profession as a video game tester and I use the same passion to ensure that games are bug-free to meet the highest standards of playability. Besides testing, my interests have evolved to include data analysis to help improve future gaming experiences. 
Therefore in this project, I will explore and visualize the relevant questions. 

1. How have video game sales trends changed over the years?
2. Which regions have the highest sales for video games?
3. How do sales trends (greater than 100 million) vary by platform?
4. Top Ten Publishers have the Highest Sales Figures.
5. Average Sales by Genre For Each Region.
6. Determine the Top 5 Publishers by Global Sales and Specify Their Top 5 Genres.
